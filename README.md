A deep learning-enhanced framework for real-time injury detection in athletes using multispectral and hyperspectral imaging technologies.

---

## Overview

Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging have emerged as powerful non-invasive techniques for detecting sports-related injuries. Unlike traditional imaging methods like X-rays or MRIs, these techniques offer high-resolution spectral data capable of capturing tissue composition and early physiological changesâ€”making them ideal for on-field, real-time diagnostics.

This project introduces a novel domain-specific imaging model that combines deep learning-based feature extraction with physics-informed constraints. The approach significantly enhances motion estimation, object tracking, and real-time analysis, enabling accurate detection and monitoring of musculoskeletal injuries in athletes.
